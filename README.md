# JavaPlayground

A collection of **Java backend practice projects** and **coding exercises** created to explore and refine skills in:
- Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Data structures and algorithms
- Backend development patterns and principles

This repository is part of an ongoing **Java skill development** and **portfolio-building** process, with a focus on preparing for backend engineering roles.

## üìÇ Structure

### **1. Core Java & OOP**
Examples and mini-projects covering:
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance & Interfaces
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### **2. Problem-Solving**
Algorithmic challenges and solutions (primarily from LeetCode):
- Arrays & Strings
- HashMaps & Sets
- Recursion & Dynamic Programming
- Sorting & Searching

### **3. Backend Practice**
Small backend-oriented projects simulating real-world concepts:
- User and game management systems
- Data persistence mockups
- System design patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Java 17 (Eclipse Adoptium)**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** for development
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## üìå Goals
- Strengthen Java fundamentals for production-level backend development
- Build a consistent problem-solving portfolio
- Prepare for technical interviews in backend engineering roles
